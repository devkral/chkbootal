This is a script for checking the boot files against sha512 signatures.
It doesn' base on a script from heise anymore.
Generation of signatures takes place at shutdown while the check takes place at boot.
Additional information: just init files for systemd are included

WARNING: Not tested yet



INSTALL:
make

sane defaults but for special wishes:

ROOTDIR: Root directory (changes the other variables by default)
BINDIR: The directory where the bash scripts are installed (default: /usr/bin/)
SYSTEMD: This variable changes where the systemd scripts are installed (default: /usr/lib/systemd/system)

LICENSE: GPL3

In the moment there are some flaws:
1. It hasn't all options
2. Bad documentation
