This is a script for checking the boot files against sha512 signatures basing on a heise script
but with much more features and native support for systemd.
Generation of signatures takes place at shutdown.
Additional information: init files are just for systemd included

WARNING: In my tests this script doesn't work and strange sideeffects happen. 



INSTALL:
make

sane defaults but for special wishes:

ROOTDIR: Root directory (changes the other variables by default)
BINDIR: The directory where the bash scripts are installed
SYSTEMD: This variable changes where the systemd scripts are installed

LICENSE: GPL2

In the moment there are four flaws:
1. It's slow because of sha512
2. It's bash 
3. A root-shell is spawnable without password
4. Even with a secured root-shell the user has too many rights. Maybe I lock the whole panic options behind a password
